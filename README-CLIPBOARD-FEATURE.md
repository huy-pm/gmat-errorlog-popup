# Copy to Clipboard Feature

The copy to clipboard functionality has already been implemented in the `gmatclub-verbal-scraping.js` bookmarklet.

## How It Works

When you run the bookmarklet on a GMAT Club verbal question page, it extracts the passage, question, and answer choices, and displays them in a popup window with a "Copy to Clipboard" button.

Clicking this button will copy all the extracted content to your clipboard in the following format:

```
[Passage content]

[Question content]

[Answer choices]
```

## Implementation Details

The feature uses the Clipboard API (`navigator.clipboard.writeText()`) to copy text to the clipboard. The implementation includes:

1. A button in the popup window with an onclick handler
2. A JavaScript function that retrieves the passage, question, and answer choices from the DOM
3. Proper formatting with double newlines separating each section
4. Error handling with user feedback via alerts

## Testing the Bookmarklet

To test the actual bookmarklet with the copy to clipboard functionality:

1. Open `final-test-all-cases.html` in your browser
2. Create a new bookmark in your browser
3. Edit the bookmark and paste the entire content of `gmatclub-verbal-scraping.js` as the URL/location
4. Save the bookmark
5. On the `final-test-all-cases.html` page, click any "Run Verbal Scraper on Test Case X" button
6. When the popup window appears, click the "Copy to Clipboard" button
7. Try pasting the content elsewhere to verify it was copied correctly

## Testing Without Bookmarklet

You can also test the clipboard functionality without using the bookmarklet:

1. Open `test-clipboard-functionality.html` in your browser
2. Click the "Copy to Clipboard" button
3. Try pasting the content elsewhere to verify it was copied correctly

## Files in This Project

- `gmatclub-verbal-scraping.js` - The main bookmarklet with copy to clipboard functionality
- `final-test-all-cases.html` - Test suite for the bookmarklet
- `test-clipboard-functionality.html` - Simple test page for clipboard functionality
- `simulate-verbal-scraping-with-clipboard.html` - Browser simulation of the bookmarklet

## Note

This feature was already implemented in the main bookmarklet script, so no additional changes were needed. The implementation has been tested and works correctly with all the provided test cases.

## Technical details

The copy to clipboard functionality uses the modern `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` API, which is supported in all modern browsers. The content is formatted with double newlines (`\n\n`) separating the passage, question, and answer choices for better readability.

## Browser compatibility

The clipboard API is supported in:
- Chrome 66+
- Firefox 63+
- Safari 13.1+
- Edge 79+

For older browsers, the feature will show an error message and suggest checking browser permissions.
