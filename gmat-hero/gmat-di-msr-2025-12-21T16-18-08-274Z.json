Formal channels include institutions such as banks, credit cooperatives, and government agencies. Loans of this type accrue positive interest and are typically court enforced. Informal credit channels include relatives, friends, community members, moneylenders, rotating savings and credit associations, and informal intermediaries. Loans such as these may or may not accrue positive interest. Loans of either type may be used by the borrower for consumption or investment in a business.\nIn 1930s rural China, informal credit was sometimes court enforced. However, it was more often self-enforcing, especially in remote areas. With a positive–interest rate loan, the borrower would pay principal and interest. With a zero–interest rate loan, the borrower would repay the principal and provide some non-monetary resource in lieu of interest. For example, the borrower might have supplied land, labor, or draft animal services to the lender.",
