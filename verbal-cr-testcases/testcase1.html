								Scientists studying climate change have found that global warming results not only in higher planetary temperatures but also in earlier springs and later autumns. While some argue that this shift is advantageous due to longer summer growing seasons, others fear that many animal species may be unable to adapt, increasing their risk of extinction.<br>       <br>Which of the following, if true, provides the strongest evidence that longer summer growing seasons caused by global warming will increase the risk of extinction for some animal species?<br>     <br><br>A. Squirrels and chipmunks store larger quantities of nuts due to longer summers, but these supplies spoil more rapidly in warmer winters, leaving fewer edible reserves.<br>B. Fungus species that typically produce spores annually now produce them twice in longer summers, disrupting the diets of animals that depend on them.<br>C. Butterfly caterpillars, responding to earlier springs, now mature into butterflies before certain bird species hatch chicks that rely exclusively on these caterpillars for food.<br>D. Salmon migrating earlier accumulate lower fat reserves, greatly reducing survival rates during migration and decreasing the number reaching breeding sites each year.<br>E. Reptiles forced to emerge earlier from hibernation spend more time foraging before mating, reducing their available energy for reproduction.																<div class="item twoRowsBlock">
