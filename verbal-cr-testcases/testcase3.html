								It is now known that to get the maximum out of a car engine one can do two things- use high octane fuel, which contains additives that extend the life and efficiency of the engine, or get the engine flushed at regular intervals, which removes all harmful substances from the engine. It has been shown by several studies that the use of high octane fuel is up to three times more effective in extending the life of the car engine than is the use of engine flushing. This does not, however, mean that engine flushing can play no role in extending the life of a car engine, because ______________________.<br><br>Which of the following logically completes the argument?<br><br>A) some studies have shown that using high octane fuel can lead to problems with a car's exhaust system.<br>B) high octane fuel costs much more than regular fuel and this cost is expected to increase even further over the next few years.<br>C) many car mechanics recommend the use of engine flushing over the use of high octane fuels.<br>D) the benefits of using high octane fuel are independent of the benefits of engine flushing.<br>E) Engine flushing when not done by expert mechanics, can cause permanent damage to the engine of the car.																<div class="item twoRowsBlock">
